## Description
This TF script is used to create a simple EC2 instance. The simple use of a variable is demonstrated here

### Note
The access-key and the secret-key needs to be added in the script before running it.


## steps to run

### To createan instance:
* terraform init
* terraform plan
* terraform apply (you will be prompted to "Enter a value:", just enter "yes")

### To destroy the instance:
* terraform destroy (you will be prompted to "Enter a value:", just enter "yes")

## Caution
Do not delete the autogenerated files by terraform i.e. 'terraform.tfstate' and 'terraform.tfstate.backup'. Deleting these files will lead to Terraform being out of sync.
